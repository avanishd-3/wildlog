,"entranceFeeDescription":"No fee is charged to travel the Blue Ridge Parkway. There is a charge for camping in any of the campgrounds along the parkway. Visitors with the Senior Pass or Access Pass (formerly Golden Age or Golden Access Passports) pay a reduced camping fee. Some activities on the parkway require a permit, such as weddings, commercial tour groups or filming, agricultural leases, scientific research, and right of way access. Please go to our permits page for additional information. All National Parks & Federal Recreational Lands Passes are available at campground kiosks on the Parkway, during their operating season, typically from the end of May through October. During the Parkway's off-season (typically November through the end of May) passes can be ordered online through the US Geological Survey. For information visit Recreational Passes | USGS Store or call 1-888-275-8747."

Under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, many national parks are allowed to keep 80% of all fees collected and use that money to fund critical projects that improve services and protect resources. In Yellowstone, fee revenue provides $12.1 million a year on average for accessibility improvements, campgrounds, infrastructure, roads, native fish restoration, aquatic invasive species mitigation, and more. Thank you for your support!"

,"entrancePassDescription":"For all annual passes, the pass holder must be present with identification for entry into Yellowstone National Park. We cannot look up information if your pass is lost or stolen and cannot accept receipts or pictures of the pass in lieu of the actual pass. On a snowmobile, annual passes admit the signer(s). When traveling by snowcoach or shuttle, they admit a signer and up to three additional adults. Children under 16 are admitted for free and are not included in these totals."

,"entranceFeeDescription":"If you enter Zion, even if just to pass through the park, you will need to buy a recreational use pass (park pass). You can get a pass at any entrance station. Payment using a credit or debit card is preferred. Cash is also accepted. Standard passes are valid for 7 days. Passes are non-transferable. After you get your pass, keep it with you and do not lose it. If you lose or forget your pass, you will have to purchase another one. You do not need to display your pass in your vehicle, but you will need to show it if you leave the park and reenter later whether you drive or walk. This means you will need to bring your park pass if you drive into Zion, leave and park in Springdale, and reenter after walking or riding a shuttle to the pedestrian & bike entrance at Zion Canyon Village."
